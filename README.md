# About travelmAIt

This is a tiny vanilla Javascript travel activity planner. 

It provides the user with weather information and potential activity ideas for their chosen location. 
The weather data is pulled from the public [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). The activity suggestions are fed via an API call to [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), which returns a response to be shown to the user. 

# The stack --> Vanilla Javascript
This app was built using simple HTML, TailwindCSS and Javascript. 
No frameworks, no verbose interfaces nor types, no fancy libraries, not even Axios! Just user inputs, our trusty & robust fetch API, and good-ol' async/await. 

Please, if you are learning Javascript or just new to coding in general, clone this repo and scan through the syntax and how I write the logic.
This it how I learn - by seeing and understanding what others do, and seeing what I can add to it or rebuild - so I urge fellow learners to try.

I hope you enjoy it, and happy building!
