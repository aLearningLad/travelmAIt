# About travelmAIt

This is a tiny vanilla Javascript travel activity planner. It makes provides the user with weather information and potential activity ideas for their chosen location. 
The weather data is pulled from the public [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). The activity suggestions are fed to an API call to ChatGPT, which returns a response to be shown to the user. 

#The stack => Vanilla Javascript
This app was built using simple HTML. TailwindCSS and Javascript. 
No frameworks, no fancy libraries, not even Axios! Just user inputs, fetch API, and good-ol' async/await. 

I hope you enjoy it!
